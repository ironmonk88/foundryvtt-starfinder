When you experience pain, the augmentation also activates the pleasure center of your brain. Because this augmentation conditions your body to associate pain with pleasure, when you attempt a saving throw against an effect that has the pain descriptor, you can roll twice and take the better result.</p>\n<p>When you take Hit Point damage or suffer an effect that has the pain descriptor, you are flooded with pleasure for 1 round. You can spend 1 Resolve Point to extend this benefit by 1d4 rounds. During this time, you ignore the shaken condition and pain effects. In addition, provided you are conscious, when you attempt a saving throw against a mind-affecting effect, you can roll twice and take the better result.</p>",
