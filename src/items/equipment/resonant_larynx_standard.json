      "value": "<p>The resonant larynx augmentation is a small resonating crystal in your throat that can amplify your voice to deafening levels. As a standard action, you can activate the resonant larynx to unleash an ear-piercing shriek in a 30-foot cone-shaped spread that doesn&rsquo;t harm you. Each creature in the area must attempt a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + half your level + your Constitution modifier). On a failure, a creature takes 5d6 sonic damage (or 10d6 for the advanced model) and is deafened for 2d4 rounds. If a creature succeeds at the saving throw, it takes half the damage and is deafened for only 1 round. Once you have used your resonant larynx, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you&rsquo;ve taken a 10-minute rest that would allow you to regain Stamina Points. However, you can spend 1 Resolve Point at any time to recharge the augmentation immediately.</p>",
