      "value": "<p>This armor upgrade is purchased as a set of two, each of which is installed in a different suit of armor. A creature wearing armor equipped with a tandem translocator can touch another creature also wearing such armor and take a standard action to attune the two creatures to each other. A tandem translocator can be attuned to only one other tandem translocator at a time. Once attuned, the two creatures become quantum entangled and can swap places with each other over vast distances. Twice per day, a creature wearing armor with this upgrade can take a standard action to activate the translocator and attempt to swap positions with the another creature to whom they are attuned; this other creature must take a reaction to allow this swap to occur. If the swap does occur, the two creatures exchange places. Tandem translocators work across any distance, but if the attuned creatures don&rsquo;t have line of sight with each other, the creature who activated the translocator must spend a Resolve Point. Tandem translocators don&rsquo;t work across planes, including the Drift; attempts to translocate across planar barriers simply fail.&nbsp; In addition to the regular rules for armor upgrades, tandem upgrades function only if another ally possesses the same upgrade and both allies currently have the same tandem upgrade installed.</p>",
