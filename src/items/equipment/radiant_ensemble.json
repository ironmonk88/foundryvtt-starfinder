It appears to be crafted from shimmering crystal, and functions as a set of formal clothing. A radiant ensemble seems to simultaneously shine (increasing the light level by one step in a 10-foot radius) and cause light to bend around it (granting a +2 circumstance bonus to saving throws against spells and effects that cause the blinded or dazzled condition). Three times per day, you can cause the radiant ensemble to give off a brilliant flash of light as a standard action. When you do so, each creature within 10 feet of you is blinded for 1d4 rounds, unless they succeed at a Reflex saving throw (DC = 10 + half your level + your key ability score modifier), in which case they are merely dazzled for 1 round.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Formal Wear</h3>\n<p>Formal wear is designed for a specific social function, such as a wedding or funeral, and commonly differs from planet to planet and even from culture to culture. Lacking the proper formal wear at a social event can cause you to take a penalty of up to &ndash;4 to Bluff, Diplomacy, and Disguise checks at the function, as determined by the GM.</p>",
