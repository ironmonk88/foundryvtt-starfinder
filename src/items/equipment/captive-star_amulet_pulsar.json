While you wear the amulet, if a spell includes you as a target, the necklace allows you to use the counter option of&nbsp;dispel magic&nbsp;against that spell as a reaction. You must attempt a dispel check (1d20 + half the amulet&rsquo;s item level + your key ability score modifier). A&nbsp;captive-star amulet&nbsp;works once per day, but you can spend 1 Resolve Point to activate it a second time during that same day. Once you use a given&nbsp;captive-star amulet, you can&rsquo;t use a different one for 24 hours.<br /><br />Captive star amulets&nbsp;come in three types with varying functions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>A&nbsp;pulsar captive-star amulet&nbsp;can function like a&nbsp;magnetar captive-star amulet. Alternatively, instead of negating and absorbing the spell, you can redirect the spell. You choose the spell&rsquo;s new targets, area, or other variables, but statistics determined by caster level are still calculated according to its original caster.</strong></p>",
