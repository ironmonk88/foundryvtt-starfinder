      "value": "<p>You have a tiny stasis generator implanted in your body with minute emitters dotting your skin. The generator has two modes: light sleep and deep sleep. You can activate or deactivate light sleep as a move action. When you do, you become absolutely still, have a minimal heat signature, and exhibit no vital signs or need to eat, sleep, or breathe. This grants you a +4 circumstance bonus to Stealth checks. You can&rsquo;t take any action other than to deactivate light sleep. You&rsquo;re dimly aware of your surroundings, but you take a &ndash;10 penalty to Perception checks. You can remain in light sleep for up to 7 consecutive days; once you emerge from light sleep, this augmentation requires 24 hours to recharge before it can be used again.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can spend 1 minute to enter deep sleep. You gain all the benefits of light sleep, but the penalty to Perception checks increases to &ndash;20. You can&rsquo;t take actions in deep sleep, but you can deactivate deep sleep and wake up, which requires 1 hour. You can remain in deep sleep for up to 1 year for every point of Constitution you have; once you emerge from deep sleep, this augmentation requires 1 week to recharge before it can be used again.</p>",
