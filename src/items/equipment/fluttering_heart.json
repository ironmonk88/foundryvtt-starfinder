As a full action, you can convincingly feign a display of meekness that lasts until you attack or perform some other hostile action (such as casting a harmful spell) or 10 minutes have passed, whichever comes first. During this time, hostile creatures attack other viable targets instead of you if any exist, though it is possible you might be included in area effects (foes don&rsquo;t avoid targeting you, they simply prioritize other viable targets). Once you use your fluttering heart, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you have rested for 10 minutes to regain Stamina Points, though you can spend 1 Resolve Point at any point to recharge it immediately.</p>",
