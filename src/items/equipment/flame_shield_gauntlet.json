      "value": "<p>Worn over existing armor, this nanofiber mesh gauntlet cradles a blood-red gem that glows faintly and gives off a small amount of warmth. This item must be worn on a free hand. You can activate the gauntlet as a reaction when you are struck by an attack or effect that deals cold damage. When you do so, until the end of your next turn, you reduce any cold damage dealt to you by half, and if an effect allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, you take no damage on a successful save. This resistance does not stack with other forms of cold resistance. Once used, the gem&rsquo;s glow fades and you can&rsquo;t use this item again until you&rsquo;ve rested for 10 minutes to regain Stamina Points, though you can spend 1 Resolve Point at any point to recharge it immediately.</p>",
