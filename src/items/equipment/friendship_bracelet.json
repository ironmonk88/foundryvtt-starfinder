Provided both of you are wearing the bracelets, each of you treats the other as if you cast a status spell on them. If you have line of sight to the other wearer, you can see them even if they are hidden or invisible, unless they do not wish to be seen by you.</p>\n<p>Nonmagical versions of these bracelets, adorned with charming insect depictions, have become a cultural staple among Hylaxians. A pair of these can be purchased for a minimum of 2 credits (though more expensive versions exist).</p>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.spells.Mn5F4th3ctW5oKJ4]{Status}</p>",
