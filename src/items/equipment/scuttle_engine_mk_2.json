      "value": "<p>Your legs are replaced by six fleshy, tentacular limbs, which protrude from an exoskeleton anchored to your spine and torso and are infused with alchemically treated magical alloys. The magic infused into the scuttle engine allows you to disrupt nearby magical energies before they form. As a reaction when someone within 60 feet of you casts a spell, you can violently thrash these limbs to send out disruptive vibrations. The spellcaster must succeed at a caster level check with a DC equal to 10 + the level of the triggering spell, or the spell fails. Add 5 to this DC if you are augmented with a mk 2 scuttle engine. Once you have used your scuttle engine, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you&rsquo;ve rested for 10 minutes to regain Stamina Points, though you can spend 1 Resolve Point at any time to recharge it immediately.</p>",
