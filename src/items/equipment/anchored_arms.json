Your insectile arms function as additional normal limbs; you can use them to hold additional equipment, but they don&rsquo;t increase the number of attacks you can make in combat. The djezet alloy infused into the chitin fibers bores into your nervous system and increases your caster level by 1 when you&rsquo;re determining the range and duration of your spells and for caster level checks. This benefit doesn&rsquo;t stack with the benefit from djezet-enhanced armor.</p>",
