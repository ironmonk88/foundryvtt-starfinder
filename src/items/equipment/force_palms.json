As a full action, you can create a globe of force that functions as resilient sphere but contains only you. The effect has a duration of concentration, to a maximum of 1 minute. Alternatively, as a full action, you can attempt to place another creature that is your size or smaller within a globe of force that is just large enough for the creature to fit in without squeezing. To do so, you must hit that creature with a melee attack against its EAC; instead of adding your Strength modifier to this attack roll, you can add your key ability score modifier if it is higher. Once you use your force palms, you can&rsquo;t use them again until you&rsquo;ve rested for 10 minutes to regain Stamina Points.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[sfrpg.spells.vYw5lZM5hlUPsyLA]{Resilient Sphere}</p>",
