At the beginning of your turn, you can spend 1 Resolve Point (this doesn&rsquo;t require an action) to ignore one of the following conditions until the beginning of your next turn: confused, frightened, or shaken. Alternatively, at the beginning of your turn, you can spend 2 Resolve Points (this doesn&rsquo;t require an action) to ignore one of the following conditions until the beginning of your next turn: cowering, dazed, panicked, or stunned. If you spend any Resolve Points in this fashion, you are staggered until the beginning of your next turn. The condition still functions normally for the purposes of duration and removing it.</p>",
