When deployed, the wings provide you with an extraordinary fly speed with clumsy maneuverability according to the model of ultralight wings you have. You can&rsquo;t deploy your ultralight wings unless your shoulders are bare or you are wearing custom clothing, and you can&rsquo;t use your wings to fly if you are encumbered, overburdened, or wearing more than light armor. Ultralight wings integrate into your natural shoulders and can be installed into prosthetic arms.</p>",
