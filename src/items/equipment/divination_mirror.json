      "value": "<p>You can use a divination mirror to display the results of divination spells that provide you with information or images, allowing others to see or otherwise experience this information as you do in real time. You must be within 30 feet of the mirror to use its capabilities. You can transmit to the mirror anything sensed by a magical sensor you create, such as with <em>arcane eye</em> or <em>clairaudience/clairvoyance</em>. The mirror can transmit sound, so you can cause it to reproduce what you hear from spells such as <em>augury</em>, <em>commune with nature</em>, <em>contact other plane</em>,<em> detect thoughts</em>, and <em>divination</em>. The mirror can display the aura of someone you subject to<em> discern lies</em>, as well as impressions and images you receive from spells such as <em>retrocognition</em> and <em>vision</em>. You can allow the mirror to transmit <em>telepathic messages</em> you receive so others present can hear that content. Divination spells that only change the nature of information you send and receive&mdash;such as <em>comprehend languages</em>, <em>tongues</em>, and <em>true seeing</em>&mdash;can&rsquo;t be used through the mirror.</p>",
