      "value": "<p>Kalistocrats have worn white since before they traveled among the stars, and certainly before those who possessed senses beyond the ones normally available to humans became Kalistocrats. This special silk can be woven into clothing to create a field around the wearer that signifies the clothing adheres to the Prophecies of Kalistrade&rsquo;s standards of decency, cleanliness, and personal boundaries. This field is perceived by all the senses of living creatures within range, in much the same way that vision perceives the attire as white (a creature might sense a smell that indicates cleanliness or perceive a vibration that indicates peacefulness). Mk 1 sense silk has a range of 30 feet. Mk 2 sense silk has a range of 100 feet. Mk 3 sense silk also has a range of 100 feet, and you can communicate telepathically with any other wearer of sense silk within that range, as long as you share a language. Sense silk can be combined with cleanliness circuits and defensive threads in a single outfit (paying each cost separately), and such an outfit counts as only one worn hybrid item.</p>",
