Symbols on clothing have long been used to create associations between a given group&rsquo;s reputation and its members. A ferocity blazon is a decorated medal or tabard whose magic enhances any impression you make so that you&rsquo;re better at intimidation.</p>\n<p>A ferocity blazon must be worn prominently to function. While you do so, when you succeed at an Intimidate check to bully or demoralize a creature, you double the duration of the effect. If you are in the captain role on a starship, when you take the taunt action and succeed at the Bluff or Intimidate check, you double the duration that enemy crew members take a penalty to checks.</p>",
