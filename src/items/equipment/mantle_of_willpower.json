High-ranking members of the Knights of Golarion and the Stewards have been known to wear such mantles, as they help keep you calm and in control of your faculties.</p>\n<p>While wearing this mantle, you gain a +2 enhancement bonus to saving throws against mind-affecting effects. In addition, as a standard action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to end all mind-affecting effects you are currently suffering from. If a mind-affecting effect renders you unable to take or determine your actions, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to end all mind-affecting effects you are currently suffering at the start of your turn, but you are then stunned until the start of your next turn. You can spend up to 2 Resolve Points per day to activate the mantle&rsquo;s abilities. Once you spend any Resolve Points using a given mantle of willpower, that mantle won&rsquo;t work for anyone else for 24 hours and you can&rsquo;t use a different one for 24 hours.</p>",
