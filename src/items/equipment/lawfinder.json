A <em>lawfinder&rsquo;s</em> needle always points toward the nearest settlement of at least 1,000 people; within such a settlement, the needle points to the primary center of government or civil administration for the settlement. This item can&rsquo;t detect a settlement more than 100 miles away, except for settlements with the bureaucratic quality (Starfinder Core Rulebook 405), which a <em>lawfinder</em> can detect up to 1,000 miles away. If no such settlements are within range, the lawfinder&rsquo;s needle spins slowly.</p>\n<p>As long as the <em>lawfinder&rsquo;s </em>needle points to a settlement or civil center, it grants you a +2 insight bonus to Survival checks to avoid getting lost.</p>",
