Wraith motes allow you to retain all your natural vision abilities, but they can also augment your vision for a number of minutes per day equal to the necrograft&rsquo;s mark. They can be activated as a swift action, or they can be activated as a reaction whenever you attempt a Perception check. They can be deactivated as a swift action. The wraith motes&rsquo; duration need not be used all at once, but it must be used in 1-minute increments.</p>\n<p>The vision granted by the wraith motes varies based on the model as follows. Higher-level models can be used to grant the vision options of a lower-level version, but only a single benefit can be gained at a time. Mk 1 wraith motes grant low-light vision. Mk 2 wraith motes grant darkvision with a range of 60 feet. Mk 3 wraith motes grant the see in darkness universal creature ability (allowing you to see perfectly in darkness of any kind, including magical darkness; Alien Archive 156). Mk 4 wraith motes grant the ability to see invisible creatures and objects (per see invisibility). Mk 5 wraith motes allow you to see into both the Ethereal Plane and Shadow Plane.</p>",
