Each set of <em>planar runeplates </em>is dedicated to a specific powerful being native to the Outer Planes, such as an archdevil, a demon lord, or a god. Devotional symbols on the plates might convince others you&rsquo;re aligned with the being in question, even if you&rsquo;re not. You wear the plates by affixing them to clothing or armor; they count as a worn magic item unless you install them in armor, taking up a number of upgrade slots equal to their mark.</p>\n<p>Each set of <em>planar runeplates </em>has the same alignment as the extraplanar entity to which the plates are dedicated, although no plates are created with a neutral alignment with no other alignment components. While you wear the plates, they have several effects. If a creature with an alignment component opposite any of the plates&rsquo; alignment components attacks you, the plates alert you to the creature&rsquo;s opposing subtypes. If the attack hits, as a reaction you can force the creature to reroll the attack and use the worse result. If you fail a saving throw against an effect created by such a creature, as a reaction you can reroll the saving throw and take the better result. Once you benefit from a given set of <em>planar runeplates</em>, you can benefit from a different set only after 24 hours have passed.</p>\n<p><em>Planar runeplates </em>allow a number of rerolls per day based on their model.</p>\n<p><strong>Mk 1 (Level 4):</strong> One reroll.</p>\n<p><strong>Mk 2 (Level 8):</strong> Two rerolls.</p>\n<p><strong>Mk 3 (Level 12):</strong> Three rerolls.</p>",
