      "value": "<p>A brown seed 2 inches long, a tangleburst seed has an inch of green root protruding from one end. Extremists among the Xenowardens smuggle these seeds all across the galaxy. Despite the seeds&rsquo; function, they&rsquo;re not technological, so they don&rsquo;t usually show up on scanners looking for weapons or dangerous devices.</p>\n<p>As a move action, you can squeeze the seed to activate it and hold it or drop it in a square within your reach. Alternatively, as a standard action, you can squeeze and throw the seed (range increment 20 feet) as a ranged attack targeting a square (AC 5). At the end of the turn in which you activate the seed, it erupts into thick vines in the square it&rsquo;s in, as well as all squares within 10 feet of the first. This area becomes difficult terrain.</p>\n<p>A creature caught in the vines must succeed at a Reflex saving throw (DC = 14 + your key ability score modifier) or become entangled. An entangled creature can escape as a move action with a successful Acrobatics check or Strength check at the same DC.</p>\n<p>The vines last and renew themselves for 5 rounds; if the seed lands on a surface made of a material in which plants can&rsquo;t normally grow, the vines last for only 2 rounds. When the duration ends, the seed and vines wither and turn to dust.</p>",
