      "value": "<p>This sacred meal, typically consumed in celebration of or on religious holidays dedicated to Hylax, was popularized on Ilemchuuva. Temples there normally produce large quantities of this meal on feast days, often at a discounted price. A queen&rsquo;s meal is not only a day&rsquo;s worth of food and water, but it also makes coordination and collaboration more effective and discourages hostility for 24 hours. While benefiting from a queen&rsquo;s meal, you take a &ndash;1 penalty to your attack rolls, but you gain a +1 divine bonus to your EAC, KAC, Perception checks, and Sense Motive checks. In addition, if you attempt to aid another creature that has also eaten a queen&rsquo;s meal that day, you apply a +2 circumstance bonus to your check. If you succeed, the highest result between you and the creature you&rsquo;re aiding can be used to determine the aided check&rsquo;s outcome.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These cooperative effects have led to a tradition among followers of Hylax who work as diplomats or negotiators. They consume a queen&rsquo;s meal at the start of talks to encourage peace. This practice was an element of the famous shirren-led peace negotiations between Castrovel&rsquo;s formians and lashuntas.</p>",
