Each set of rune-etched chitin is inscribed with spells that have a combined level equal to the augmentation&rsquo;s mark. You can be augmented with rune-etched chitin only if the spells inscribed onto it are spells you could learn and cast at your current level, though you don&rsquo;t have to know them. You can cast each of the spells inscribed on the runeetched chitin once per day at a caster level equal to the augmentation&rsquo;s level without using your own spell slots. You must have this augmentation implanted for at least 24 hours for it to function.</p>",
