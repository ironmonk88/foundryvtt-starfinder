Defensive threads were designed to be sewn into clothing to detect when the wearer is about to be touched. While active, the threads automatically move the fabric to ensure that no skin stays exposed near any appendage belonging to another creature. The mk 2 version of this item provides even more protection; when you take the total defense action, the bonus to your Armor Class increases by 1. Defensive threads can be combined with cleanliness circuits and sense silk in a single outfit (paying each cost separately), and such an outfit counts as only one worn hybrid item.</p>",
