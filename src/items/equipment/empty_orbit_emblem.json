      "value": "<p>An Empty Orbit emblem serves as a badge of office for solarians of the Order of the Empty Orbit, or those honored by that organization. The emblem itself is a metal token depicting the orbit of planets in the Pact Worlds System, including a noticeable gap between Castrovel and Akiton. The emblem counts as a worn magic item unless you install it in armor, which takes up one upgrade slot. When you wear this emblem in an easily visible location, including as an armor upgrade, you receive a +2 circumstance bonus to Diplomacy checks against those who uphold the philosophy of the Cycle or who hold the Cosmonastery of the Empty Orbit in high esteem. Additionally, up to twice per day, when you rest for 10 minutes and spend 1 Resolve Point to regain Stamina Points, you can meditate on this emblem to also regain 2d8+5 Hit Points. Members of the Order of the Empty Orbit and their allies take these emblems seriously, and wearing one falsely is likely to have negative social consequences.</p>",
