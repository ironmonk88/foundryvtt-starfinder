A set of energy-relay gloves is permanently configured to one damage type selected from among acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. The gloves count as a worn magic item unless you install them in armor, taking up one upgrade slot.</p>\n<p>If you hit with a weapon attack while wearing energyrelay gloves and deal additional damage, you can convert that additional damage to the gloves&rsquo; type. The gloves can convert additional damage from a class feature, a feat, and the additional damage dealt on critical hit, but they can&rsquo;t convert additional damage from equipment, changes to a weapon&rsquo;s damage dice, or spells. Using the gloves doesn&rsquo;t change whether the attack targets EAC or KAC.</p>",
