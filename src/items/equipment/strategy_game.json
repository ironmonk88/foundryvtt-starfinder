Some are even revered pastimes in specific cultures. Only physical strategy games have bulk; computer games have no bulk but generally consume 1 charge per hour of play. D</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Basic (Level 1):</strong> If two to six characters spend 1 hour playing a basic strategy game together, each can roll an Intelligence check, with the highest result determining the game&rsquo;s winner (reroll ties). The next time the strategy game&rsquo;s winner attempts to use aid another to assist any of the other players of that game session, the DC of the aid another check is reduced by 1. A single basic strategy game can provide this benefit only once per week.</li>\n</ul>",
